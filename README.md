# CS314-CheckStyle-Guide

Hey guys! So I created a github that'll included needed files and links for installation processes for a few IDE's that y'all could be using.
Of course if you wish for me to add another one, then I will do so. 

*NOTE: I am not 100% sure of either the IntelliJ or VsCode's installation processes, however I hope these given links will help guide you.
